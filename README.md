# lab_Dictionaries_2_stock
After you have completed your first task, your boss decides to give you another one right away. Now not only you have to keep track of the stock, but also you should answer customers if you have some products in stock or not.
You will be given key-value pairs of products and quantities (on a single line separated by space). On the following line, you will be given products to search for. Check for each product. You have 2 possibilities:
•	If you have the product, print "We have {quantity} of {product} left".
•	Otherwise, print "Sorry, we don't have {product}".

Sorry, we don't have jam

We have 10 of ham left
